## General info

I made this project to apply everything I'm learning about Bootstrap 5.

The site was written from scratch and the design was taken from [this template](https://demo.htmlhunters.com/profi/restaurant.html). <br> I have added and improved a few things to make it more visually appealing.

I had some trouble figuring out how to use Bootstrap at the start.<br>
When I create a website I always do it from a large screen to a smaller screen size.<br>
So I felt like I was doing things backward. <br>
With Bootstrap you start by assuming that you are with a single column
and then you divide it up. <br>
After reading the documentation, figuring this out it was really easy to get the layouts that I wanted.

What I like about Bootstrap:<br>
Faster development. It saved me a lot of time not having to write everything from scratch.<br>
The consistency. Everything feels structured. I found this a hard thing to do with other projects.<br>
Easy to customize. It was not hard to create my own custom classes.<br>
The responsiveness. Almost didn't have to use media-queries.<br>

What I dislike about Bootstrap:<br>
Not semantic. I feel like it gets a bit bloated with so many classes in a single div.

I'll create another project with Bootstrap4 to consolidate my knowledge.
